# Buzz Mobile App

- Music is one of the few concepts that has been known to universally unify people. While apps like TikTok do great at connecting people through a wide breadth of similar interests, it sometimes fails at developing deep conncetions in niches and subniches. One of those niches being music. As a music fan myself, I sometimes wish there was an similar to TikTok that was solely filled with music related content and music fans such as myself.
- While TikTok's algorithm displays music related content to me, it is not always about the artists that I am into or even necessarily the subgenres I enjoy. That's where Buzz comes in. Buzz is setup in such a way that it can accomplish connecting users to the content of their liking similarly to TikTok, but exceedingly well for music. 
- Below are some screenshots and videos of the app in action:
